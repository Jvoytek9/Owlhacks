#Owlhacks

A school hackathon. I used the surfactant dashboard I had been crafting during my time researching and manipulated it to work with Philly bailfund data for this hackathon. Overall, a bit buggy since it was a 24hr hackathon. However, this project helped me realize I could port the surfactant dashboard and do more with it, so I made it easier to change datasets come the data challenge.

This is implementation 2/3 of the portable dashboard I had been producing.
